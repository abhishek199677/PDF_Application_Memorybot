# Workflow of PDF RAG Chatbot

## PDF Document Ingestion
* Upload or specify the PDF files to be processed.
* Use PDF parsing libraries (e.g., PyPDF2, pdfplumber) to extract text content from the PDFs.

## Preprocessing & Indexing
* Clean and preprocess the extracted text (remove noise, split into manageable chunks).
* Create an index of the document content using vector embeddings (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone).

## Query Input
User inputs a question or query through the chatbot interface.

## Retrieval of Relevant Information
* Convert the user query into an embedding vector.
* Retrieve the most relevant document chunks from the index based on similarity.

## Response Generation
* Feed the retrieved chunks along with the user query into a language model (e.g., GPT).
* Generate a context-aware, accurate response based on the retrieved information.

## Output to User
*  Present the generated answer to the user through the chatbot interface.

## Iterative Interaction
* Allow follow-up questions and continuous interaction, maintaining context if needed.
